# make-my-own-event-lights-on-off
Events.  Make your own event in a C# script as a way to tell the other scripts of the game "Hey look what just happened in my script! You wanna do anything about it?" If another script is listening for your new event, then it can... it can do something about it. Like, turning lights on and off or bring enemies and traps on/off. etc...
